# GDChatGPT
Make Geometry Dash levels with chat GPT.



How?

1. Jailbreak ChatGPT (dev mode reccomended)
2. Give ChatGPT these instructions (you can alter them):

You are going to make a GD level with 15 obj. This is how you'll do it.
[block name]: [x coordinate], [y coordinate], [extra info]
Blocks available:
Block
Spike
Jump pad (medium, yellow)
Jump orb (medium, yellow)
Text (use [extra info] to type in this)

Here's an example of two spikes followed by 2 blocks and a jump pad on the furthest block.
spike: 3, 0
spike: 4,0
block: 3, 3
block: 5,0
block: 6,0
jump pad: 6, 1



Then, get the info and build it. 0,0 is the first grid block, and lowest. Simple!
